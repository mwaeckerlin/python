# Docker Image to Run Python Software

This is a minimalistic, highly optimized and secure image to run Python software. Use it in the last build step when building docker images for your Python project using [mwaeckerlin/python](https://github.com/mwaeckerlin/python).

This image only contains Python and direct dependencies, so the image size only about 51MB, while the official Docker Hub library Python image is 925MB fat.
